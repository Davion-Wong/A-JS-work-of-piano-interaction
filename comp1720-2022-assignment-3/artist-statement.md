# Artist Statement

Write your artist statement in this file (max 200 words).

Answer the following:

- What your interactive artwork is?
- How interaction enhances the viewerâ€™s experience?


This is an interactive artwork with a significant sonic component. As it does not represent any specific items in real world, I think it can be seen as abstract. 

The idea comes from piano tutorial videos, which displays notations on the screen to let the user know when and where he should press on the piano.

Presssing various keys on the keyboard enables various sound. Press corresponding keys when the notes on the fall onto the circle at the screen bottom, then a good music can be played by the user. Key 'BackSpace', 'Left'/'Right', and 'Up'/'Down' can be used to reset music, switch music, and enable/disable auto-play. It needs practice, otherwise the user can only output a jumble of tones.

Besides the loaded piano sound at the prelude stage, all sounds are generated by oscillators, and controlled by envelopes. Each effective interaction is relected as a certain kind of visual feedback on the screen.

It performs well on Chrome browser, while on Firefox the sound can be hoarse.
